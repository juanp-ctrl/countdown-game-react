# The almost final countdown game

A mini-project part of the React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. React Router & Redux) by @maxschwarzmueller.

In this excercise we made use of refs to allow us a better use and control of timers in the game, also exposing the API of a component to understand the possibilities of forwarding a ref to a component and its capability of modifying the DOM. Finally we made use of portals part of the react-dom package to insert into the correct element the modal component we created using the dialog native element.
